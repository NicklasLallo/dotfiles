" WARNING: This file defines and runs a command called fixamo_quiet. If you
" also have a malicious addon that operates on `<all_urls>` installed this
" will allow it to steal your firefox account credentials!
"
" With those credentials, an attacker can read anything in your sync account,
" publish addons to the AMO, etc, etc.
"
" Without this command a malicious addon can steal credentials from any site
" that you visit that is not in the restrictedDomains list.
"
" You should comment out the fixamo lines unless you are entirely sure that
" they are what you want.
"
" The advantage of running the command is that you can use the tridactyl
" interface on addons.mozilla.org and other restricted sites.

" Provided only as an example.
" Do not install/run without reading through as you may be surprised by some
" of the settings.

" May require the latest beta builds.

" Move this to $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/tridactyl/tridactylrc (that's
" ~/.config/tridactyl/tridactylrc to mere mortals) or ~/.tridactylrc and
" install the native messenger (:installnative in Tridactyl). Run :source to
" get it in the browser, or just restart.

" NB: If you want "vim-like" behaviour where removing a line from
" here makes the setting disappear, uncomment the line below.
