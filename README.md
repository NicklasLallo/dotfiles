This picture isn't quite accurate any more.

## Instructions:
You can easily pick and choose the parts you like without having to use everything. Each folder is named after a package and contains every configuration file used by that application. The files inside the folders are relative to home (e.g. the file `vim/.vimrc` goes to `~/.vimrc`).

Since these are dotfiles they obviously require you to also install the original software you want these files to configure for you, they are after all only the configuration files.


To more quickly set things up I recommend to use GNU Stow to symlink the dotfiles.
1. Clone the repo into your home folder, e.g. `~/dotfiles`.
2. Install stow from your package manager. (or do the symlinks manually, see: `man ln`)
3. Backup any of your original config files you want to keep around.
4. Download the submodules (additional git repos) with `git submodule init` & `git submodule update`.
5. Go to the repo and run `stow vim` or similar to symlink the files associated with that part of the setup.

## Considerations
My setup uses two monitors, one of which is an ultrawide monitor with an unusually high resolution (3440x1440). If you use this on any other system you will have to manually tweak the positioning of the polybar segments. This is not difficult, simple math should suffice. Same with the gaps/borders, they are most likely to large on for example only a single 1080p or 720p monitor. The i3 config file also says wich workspace should go on which monitor (use `xrandr` to find the names of your monitors).

Also, even though I intend for these configuration files to be modular and somewhat independant, I still highly recomend that you read through every file before you use it. Who knows what I might have included in here.

## Submodules
In order to not copy others' repos into this repo some things such as oh-my-zsh are included in the form of submodules. This means that after you `git clone` this repo you will need to also run `git submodule init` and then `git submodule update`.

Some other things that could be submodules aren't at the moment, such as some fonts or small scripts. That might change in the future.

### Addons
Many of the dotfiles require additional software/plugins or such that aren't imediately obvious, for example extra fonts, or other programs that don't require their own dotfiles, I have tried to document those in this file but I will have most likely missed one or more of them.
+ Various fonts for polybar (check the polybar config file). And Nerdfonts for Kitty (should be included for now).
+ ranger is using [ranger\_devicons](https://github.com/alexanderjeurissen/ranger_devicons).
+ tmux is using [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline).
+ tmux also has a plugin manager, run `prefix shift+i` once first time you start it and it should set everything up by itself.
+ zsh is using multiple plugins such as [spaceship](https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/). They should all be included as submoduels for now.
+ vim has a lot of plugins, they are managed by Plug from inside vim.

### Fonts
Some fonts are included in here, such as a version of Iosevka Mono that it patched with ligatures that actually work in Kitty (from Fira Code), as well as nerdfonts Hack (so that Iosevka call fallback onto Hack for any strange Nerdfonts symbols). After doing `stow fonts` it is also neccessary to do `sudo fc-cache -f` to get the fonts working.

## Custom keybinds
### i3
Mostly defauly keybindings as to not confuse other i3 users. For more information check out the i3 config file. Here are some additions:
+ `super + enter` - Launch Kitty running tmux
+ `super + Shift + enter` - Launch Kitty running ranger
+ `super + d` - Launch Rofi
+ `super + hjkl` - Move focus with vim-keys
+ `super + n` - run pywal, automatically select a new random wallpaper from `~/wallpapers/inuse`, generate new colorthemes for polybar, kitty, and much more, and automatically tell those applications to update (polybar restarts quietly). This is also done on each restart.

### vim
A lot of custom settings, mostly documented inside `.vimrc`.
+ TODO

### tmux
One of the main programs that have changed a lot from default in terms of keybindings. Default terminal copy-paste should still work as expected (`ctrl+shift+c`, mouse double, & tripple click for copy; middle mouse button, or `ctrl+shift+v` for paste).
+ Enable default vi-bindings (expect in command mode).
+ `ctrl + w` - Prefix, instead of `ctrl + b`. More vim like. Double press sends `ctrl + w` to the underlaying application. I prefer to not use splits much in vim anyways, and instead use buffers (fzf switch with `ctrl+b`) or tabs. And it is still possible to do the vim window splits it just requires more work right now.
+ `Prefix + r` - Reload tmux config.
+ `Prefix + w` - choose-tree -Zw, useful for managing multiple tmux windows/sessions.
+ `Prefix + s` & `Prefix + v` - Split horisontaly and vertically, same as vim. (using `"` or `%` is also still possible)
+ Mouse off - Current solution to make the mouse behave as expected when doing quick copy-paste from terminal. Not perfect with selecting text from vertical split panes. Try to use extrakto instead.
+ `Prefix + ctrl-u` - Copy-mode.
+ `Prefix + c` - New windows (commonly reffered to as a tab outside of tmux lingo)
+ `Prefix + hjkl` - select pane.
+ `Prefix + HJKL` - resize pane, repeatable.
+ `Prefix + q` - kill pane. Same as vim close window. (default display panes moved to `Prefix + ctrl-q`)
+ `Prefix + /`, go to copy mode and search.
+ copy-mode-vi `/` & `?` - Uses incremental search (same as vim incsearch).
+ copy-mode-vi `v` - begin selection.
+ copy-mode-vi `V` - select line.
+ copy-mode-vi `ctrl+v` - begin block-selection.
+ copy-mode-vi `Home` - start of line.
+ copy-mode-vi `End` - end of line.
+ copy-mode-vi `y` - copy selection.
+ `Prefix + I` - Install plugins. Run once and forget. (`Prefix + U` update plugins), shift+i
+ `Prefix + Tab` - Start [extrakto](https://github.com/laktak/extrakto) plugin. This is magic. Requires fzf.
+ No non prefix keybindings that start with `ctrl` due to risk of colisions with applications running inside, such as vim/fzf.
+ `Alt + Arrows` - Switch panes. Leave `Alt+hjkl` for the shell or vim.
+ `Shift + Left/Right` - Switch windows.

## Wallpapers
The wallpaper is set with feh & pywal in the i3 configuration, as startup command.
+ It selects a random wallpaper from a folder (default ~/wallpapers/inuse).
+ `Super + n` - Randomly select a new wallpaper, and redo the themes on surrounding applications to match using pywal.
+ TODO more info.

## Scripts & Aliases
+ `bm` (**b**ook**m**ark) - Appends the current working directory (path) into a file in your home directory. If passed any additional text it will append that as a comment on the line in the file. I use this to bookmark all my most commonly visited locations in the file system. Another option is to use [z](https://github.com/rupa/z).
+ `cdb` (**cd** **b**ookmark) - Opens the file of bookmarks from your home directory, passes the lines to [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), allows you to fuzzy search select a bookmark based on path or comment, and then changes your current directory to that location.
+ `fshow` - Git commit browser. `enter` for show, `Ctrl-d` for diff, \` toggles sort.
+ Various git log FZF scripts, see the `.zshrc` file for more details.
+ `Ctrl+r`, `Ctrl+t`, `Alt+c` - Default fzf behaviour.
+ `Ctrl+f` - fzf fuzzy search for file recursively down from current location, opens selection for editing in vim. By default requires that fd is installed.
+ `Ctrl+j` - fzf fuzzy search the result of [z](https://github.com/rupa/z). z is installed as a plugin bundled with oh-my-zsh.
+ `cdd` - `cd ~/dotfiles`
+ `cdf` - cd to the directory of fzf fuzzy find filename.
+ `fkill` - fzf search all processes you have permission to kill, SIGTERM the selection.
+ `gs[tatus]` - git status (These and a few others come from the oh-my-zsh bundled git plugin)
+ `gp[ush]` - git push (These and a few others come from the oh-my-zsh bundled git plugin)
+ `gl` - git pull (These and a few others come from the oh-my-zsh bundled git plugin)
+ `ga glo gi gd grh gcf gss gclean` - git+fzf magic from [forgit](https://github.com/wfxr/forgit). Included copy in `oh-my-zsh/custom/plugin`
+ `l` - `ls -lah`
+ `:e` - `vim`
+ `:q` - `exit`
+ Read the `.zshrc` file for more information
